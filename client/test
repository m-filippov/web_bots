# 1.4.2-31

CHANGED:
* Migrated to new UnityBase and UB packages to support Security User Groups
  * **NOTE**: Cleaned up initialization data for OLD roles (buyer/requestor/supplyChain), new environments won't have
    these roles!  Do not use them.  Instead, use new feature-scoped system roles and user groups.
    To give an access level for a user, include the user into a security group, do not give any role to the user!

  decimal sign precision.
* PLN: Added "budgetPPU" attribute to pln_ProjectQuantity (aggregated demand quantities for a sourcing project) to fix
  the price.
  * **NOTE**: For existing sourcing projects the attribute value would not be sane.  Attribute is filled with a new
              logic, which was not there at the time the sourcing projects were created.
              In order to fix that, either delete all the sourcing projects, OR run the following SQL script manually,
              it will set the price to value in SKU dictionary:

    ```sql
    UPDATE pq
       SET budgetPPU = si.budgetPPU
      FROM pln_ProjectQuantity pq
      JOIN mdm_SkuItem si ON si.ID = pq.skuID

    pln_Project_cat.meta was removed.
  * Added `pln_ProjectSku`, where SKU price is locked
  * `pln_Project` horizon fields changed from `Date` type to `Int` (months since 2000-Jan) - just like done for budget

* validation on create sourcing project form
* header to tree-grid on Sourcing Project form
* VUE.budgetImport: validation on row editing
* VUE.budgetImport: autocomplete dictionaries on row editing

* aligned headers and data in treegrid (Needs Aggregation component)
* renamed `Sourcing Project` component to `Needs Aggregation`

* !!! BREAKING !!! Removed `pln_ProjectItem` entity entirely.  Now `pln_ProjectItemInterval` contains reference
  `itemID` to `pln_Project` - directly.  It also contains `costCenterID`, so that quantities are broke down not only
  by intervals, but by cost centers.
* Renamed `departmentID` "many" attribute in `pln_Project` to `costCenterID` and it now may refer `org_unit`, not just
  `org_department` (shall be enforced to departments and organizations only though).
* Cached `mdm_SkuItem` and `mdm_SkuCategory` dictionaries

# 1.0.1

CHANGED:
* !!! BREAKING !!! Entities `pln_ProjectItemInterval` and `bdg_BudgetItemInterval` both have column `interval`,
  its type change from `Date` to `Int` with meaning "number of months since 2000 January", so that `0` means
   2000 January, "1" - 2000 February, etc.  If for some reason you need to go before 2000 year, use negative numbers,
   "-1" would be 1999 December.
* `mdm_Uom` remove unique constraint from `shortName` attribute.

# 1.0.0-4

ADDED:
* Custom form for Uom, Cost Group and Fin Accounts

CHANGED:
* For MDM custom forms (SKU category, SKU item, Procedure) added more intellectual form title - it depends on

FIXED:
* A bug in `mdm_Procedure` - when duration was not changed, but only name, validation did not allow to save record

# 1.0.0-2

CHANGED:
* `mdm_SkuItem` entity - changed criticality to High/Medium/Low enumeration from integer, according to changed in
  FRS-MDM-01 spec

# 1.0.0-1

FIXED:
* Migrated to the most fresh UB version, where fixed bugs impacted on Org dictionaries and SKU dictionaries

ADDED:
* Custom SKU Category form
* SKU Items and SKU dictionaries have "caption" attribute now, which is built by pattern "<code> - <name>"
* SKU Category has "tree" mixin now, which would make it possible to build faster working SKU Category tree selection
  control
